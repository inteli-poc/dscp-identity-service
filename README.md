# Veritable Identity Service

## Description

A `Node.js` API to support communication to the [Substrate-based](https://www.substrate.io/) [`veritable-node`](https://github.com/digicatapult/dscp-node) (via [`polkadot-js/api`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@polkadot/api)) and an [`IPFS`](https://ipfs.io/) node.

## Getting started

First, ensure you're running the correct [version](.node-version) of `npm`, then install dependencies using:

```
npm install
```

The API requires instances of Postgresql and [`veritable-node`](https://github.com/digicatapult/dscp-node).
To bring this up locally:

### `veritable-node`

Clone [veritable-node](https://github.com/digicatapult/dscp-node) and follow the README to setup and build a local node. Then run the following in its root directory:

```
./target/release/dscp-node --dev
```

Or run

```
docker-compose up -d
```

and run the DB migrations

```
npx knex migrate:latest --env test
```

## Environment Variables

`veritable-identity-service` is configured primarily using environment variables as follows:

## Running the API

Having ensured dependencies are installed and running + the relevant environment variables are set, the API can be started in production mode with:

```
npm start
```

## API specification

### Authenticated endpoints

If `AUTH_TYPE` env is set to `JWT`, the rest of the endpoints in `veritable-identity-service` require authentication in the form of a header `'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'`:

1. [GET /members/](#GET-/members)
2. [GET /members/:address](#PUT-/members/:address)

The following endpoints are maintained for backwards compatibility:

### GET /members

The `address` parameter identifies the user running this process, and the `alias` representing a more friendly name version of this. The default value of the latter is null, and is optionally set.

```json
[
  {
    "address": "5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY",
    "alias": "ALICE"
  }
]
```

### PUT /members/:address

The `address` parameter identifies the user running this process, and the `alias` representing a more friendly name version of this. The default value of the latter is null, and is optionally set.

```json
{
  "address": "5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY",
  "alias": "ALICE_UPDATED"
}
```
